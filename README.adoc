## Why

* Readability
* Maintainability
* Modularity
* Scalability

### Readability

Readability is the ease with which a reader can understand a written text. Used within the domain of computer science, it's the quality of a code file that allows users to easily understand the logic. Things such as choice data structures, choice of names, and formatting conventions influences the readability quality. footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability]

### Maintainability

Maintainability is the ease with which a product can be maintained in order to, but not restricted to footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintainability]:

* fix bugs,
* repair or replace faulty or outdated components without having to replace still working parts,
* meet new requirements, or
* make future maintenance easier

### Modularity

Modularity is the degree to which a system may be separated and recombined by building it with standardized units or dimensions for flexibility and variety in use. footnote:[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/modularity]

In modular programming, *standardized units* are independent, interchangeable *modules*, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of a desired functionality. footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming]

### Scalability

The ability of a system to adapt and being easily expanded or upgraded on demand. footnote:[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scalability]
