## Why

* Readability
* Maintainability
* Modularity
* Scalability

### Readability

Readability is the ease with which a reader can understand a written text. Used within the domain of computer science, it's the quality of a code file that allows users to easily understand the logic. Things such as choice data structures, choice of names, and formating conventions influences the readability quality.

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability

### Maintainability

Maintainability is the ease with which a product can be maintained in order to, but not restricted to:

* fix bugs,
* repair or replace faulty or outdated components without having to replace still working parts,
* meet new requirements, or
* make future maintenance easier

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintainability

### Modularity

Modularity is the degree to which a system may be separated and recombined by building it with standardized units or dimensions for flexibility and variety in use.

In modular programming, *standardized units* are independent, interchangeable *modules*, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of a desired functionality.

### Scalability

The ability of a system to adapt and being easily expanded or upgraded on demand.
